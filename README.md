FruitNameGame

Simple game to match the name of the fruit to the picture of the fruit.

Created the form and added a listbox to test reading the text file into the game.

Currently trying to figure out if it is best to read the file directly to the listbox or into an array.

List/Array will need to be randomized so each game is a little different.

Need to decide of word will be removed from list so it isn't picked again in the current round or if it should be
added to a different list and compared. Leaning toward removing from list, quicker.

Game can be expanded to include vegetables, animals, objects, etc.
